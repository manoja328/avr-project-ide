Thanks to the following open source projects:

[DockPanel Suite](http://dockpanelsuite.sourceforge.net/) for letting me add the docking windows and tab system just like in Visual Studio.

[Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/) for being an excellent code editor, this is the same component used in Notepad++, Notepad2, and a bunch of other great development environments out there.

[ScintillaNet](http://www.codeplex.com/ScintillaNET) for allowing me to use Scintilla to be used with a C# Windows Form.

[LibUsbDotNet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbdotnet/) for allowing me to use libusb to make my USB Panel feature.

[Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) for being open source and letting me see how it builds its sketches.

[WinAVR](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/) for the tools used to build and burn projects.
