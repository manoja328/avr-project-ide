#summary Help regarding using and writing templates

The template file is templates.xml in the application data folder. See CustomizationHelp on how to find this file.

When a template is applied, only the settings that it needs to touch are modified, other project settings are NOT returned to default, they are LEFT ALONE.

Templates cannot include files

===Adding a Custom Template===

The XML for a template looks like:

{{{
  <template name="Arduino ATMega8 8MHz">
    <Device>atmega8</Device>
    <ClockFreq>8000000</ClockFreq>
    <BurnPart>atmega8</BurnPart>
    <BurnProgrammer>stk500</BurnProgrammer>
    <BurnOptions>-F</BurnOptions>
    <BurnBaud>19200</BurnBaud>
  </template>
}}}

The each template is stored in its own "template" tag, with a "name" attribute.

The easiest way to write your own template is to save a project with the desired settings, and then open the .avrproj file with a text editor. Copy and paste in the tags that you want the template to set.

A template can inherit from other templates by doing something like this:

{{{
<Inherit>Arduino ATMega8 8MHz</Inherit>
}}}
