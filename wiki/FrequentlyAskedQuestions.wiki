#summary Frequently Asked Questions

===What are those checkboxes for beside my files?===

Unchecked files are ignored during the build process.

===Why can't I checkmark my .h or .hpp files?===

You can't compile those, or at least, shouldn't.

===How do I tell the project what language I am using===

You don't have to, if a file is cpp, then it will be compiled with avr-g++, if a file is c, then avr-gcc is used, if any pde files are found, then the build process will use the same method that Arduino's editor builds the project.

Note that you can't "supplement" a C or C++ project with a pde file as the Arduino core already defines a main function.
