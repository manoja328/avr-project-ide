#summary Help for users who are switching from AVRStudio

==Importing and Exporting==

Not much to explain here, you can import and export AVRStudio projects (.aps files). If you import an aps file, debugging and simulator settings are preserved so when you export the aps file again, the settings for the debugger and simulator will remain untouched.

Keep in mind that AVRStudio is not friendly with C++ projects.
